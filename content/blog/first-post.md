I have long wanted to blog more consistently but always got bogged down in what service to use, and how to use it... or whether I should wait until I could build one myself. Fortunately I came to my senses and no longer think building it from scratch myself makes sense, so I went with a happy medium and am using Hugo and firebase for my needs. Hopefully this helps me learn a bit of website management as well as some more 'coding' skills in my quest for a better understanding of the web.
