I fell in love with gochujang when I went for Korean BBQ the first time with a friend. It's subtle and sweet spice is delicious in so many unique ways. I found a [recipe](https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-gochujang-fried-chicken) for my Anova sous-vide on their site and I couldn't wait to try it.

Overall it wasn't too much work and it definitely was good practice with frying in the pan. That same friend who introduced me to gochujang also showed me some better frying technique when he made me some mad good spring rolls. So I tried to follow his advice and I think it worked well. Really the mistake I generally made was making the oil far too hot before cooking. For this I heated up my cast iron pan with a bit of oil and then turned it right down on to low once it popped when I let a droplet of water hit it.

The only change I made from the recipe was to throw the chicken on top of a bed of vermicelli noodles, mostly just because I had them on hand. I put a little fish sauce on them as well for some added flavour. Overall... super solid meal and made for pretty good leftovers too... though the chicken did lose its crunch.
