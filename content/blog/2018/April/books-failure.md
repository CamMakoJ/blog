I have been trying to read more lately, and by read its been mostly audiobooks. I recently discovered that I can use my local libraries online system to get both e-books and audiobooks on my phone for free which is awesome!

Check out [Libby](https://meet.libbyapp.com/) it is an awesome front end for using your local library resources, and at least where I live its totally free. Definitely worth checking out if you like reading or listening to books.

Anyway in reading the
[The Talent Code](https://amzn.to/2HduWYK),
[Creativity Inc.](https://amzn.to/2HduWYK), and
[The 4-Hour Workweek](https://amzn.to/2HduWYK)
I saw a trend in the importance of failure for both learning and growth. I have spent most of my life trying to succeed and in general appear successful. This has typically meant working towards not failing, with the mindset that it was the opposite of the success I was looking for.
