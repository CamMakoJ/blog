I am headed up North to fish near Jasper this weekend. I am pretty excited I've never been up that way before and its with some good buddies. I have been prepping so far this week by tying up some flies, which I am still learning but there are some simpler streamer patterns that I'm not too bad at.

This is just a little taste of what I was working on... hopefully I will be able to post that some of these flies were super effective.
