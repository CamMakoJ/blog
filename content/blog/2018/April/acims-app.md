I started working on a write up of the ACIMS app that I made as a project. The intent of
the writeup is both so that I can document what I did properly, but also so that I can hopefully
share with others the process I went through. Though this is mostly to help me improve my understanding
of what I have worked on, as having not re-visited it in awhile its very easy to forget. Check
out the [ACIMS App]({{< relref "docs/acims-app.md" >}}) documentation here.
