      <title>ACIMS App</title>

      <description>About the app The ACIMS app was developed after experiencing the frustration of forgetting the ACIMS list at home and trying to download the spreadsheet onto my phone. Spreadsheets in general aren&amp;rsquo;t awesome experiences on mobile and can be quite cumbersome. This was definitely the case with the massive ACIMS list and so I wanted to make it better. I also have always been interested in learning to code for a long time but hadn&amp;rsquo;t had the motivation to seriously learn.</description>

      <description>I started working on a write up of the ACIMS app that I made as a project. The intent of the writeup is both so that I can document what I did properly, but also so that I can hopefully share with others the process I went through. Though this is mostly to help me improve my understanding of what I have worked on, as having not re-visited it in awhile its very easy to forget.</description>

      <description>I have long wanted to blog more consistently but always got bogged down in what service to use, and how to use it&amp;hellip; or whether I should wait until I could build one myself. Fortunately I came to my senses and no longer think building it from scratch myself makes sense, so I went with a happy medium and am using Hugo and firebase for my needs. Hopefully this helps me learn a bit of website management as well as some more &amp;lsquo;coding&amp;rsquo; skills in my quest for a better understanding of the web.</description>
