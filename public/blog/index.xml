      <description>I started working on a write up of the ACIMS app that I made as a project. The intent of the writeup is both so that I can document what I did properly, but also so that I can hopefully share with others the process I went through. Though this is mostly to help me improve my understanding of what I have worked on, as having not re-visited it in awhile its very easy to forget.</description>

      <description>I have long wanted to blog more consistently but always got bogged down in what service to use, and how to use it&amp;hellip; or whether I should wait until I could build one myself. Fortunately I came to my senses and no longer think building it from scratch myself makes sense, so I went with a happy medium and am using Hugo and firebase for my needs. Hopefully this helps me learn a bit of website management as well as some more &amp;lsquo;coding&amp;rsquo; skills in my quest for a better understanding of the web.</description>
