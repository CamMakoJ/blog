      <title>Turning Shapefiles into a GPX</title>

      <description>Quite often for environmental field work I need to convert shapefiles or other GIS formats into GPX files. Now this would seem like it should be a simple task for the mighty QGIS. However in many cases its not as simple as hitting export and choosing the gpx file type. What I have found is super helpful is considering what I typically see in GPX files. Routes, Tracks, and Waypoints. This is a little different then the points, lines, and polygons of the shapefile world.</description>

      <title>Avenza Georeferenced Maps in QGIS</title>

      <description>I have tried using Avenza PDF in the past on my phone but was never able to get an easily exportable map to work with it from QGIS. That was until I actually tried to google around a bit and figure out how to make it work. I am using QGIS 3.2 so was unable to use some of the plugins that I had found as they were for earlier versions of QGIS and haven&amp;rsquo;t been updated at this time.</description>

      <title>Using Expressions in a QGIS Atlas</title>

      <description>It has taken me a long time to get comfortable with the print composer in QGIS. I think for me the biggest issue is once you hit that composer you need to combine all the data you have worked with and make it look appealing while conveying the message you are trying to tell with the map. It&amp;rsquo;s art, it&amp;rsquo;s science, it&amp;rsquo;s cartography! It also can be a very fun part of telling the data&amp;rsquo;s story and I love maps for that as they can show a lot in a simple way.</description>

      <title>AER Shapefile Submissions</title>

      <description>The AER One Stop is a great regulator solution to some of the uncertainty in project delivery, such as to who to send what to. However it has created some confusion on its own that I have dealt with when formatting shapefiles for upload to the site. I have really only used this feature as part of Water Activities and they have since released guidelines on how to ensure your shapefile complies with their filters.</description>

      <title>Creating a DEM from Contours</title>

      <description>Contours Contours are a great way to visualize topography on a flat map without covering background imagery. It is often great for figures where you want a visible basemap.
Digital Elevation Model That being said it is nice to have a digital elevation model (DEM) for easier interpretation of what the ground is looking like. I find this easier to see where there are steep slopes and depressions that may be wetlands.</description>

      <description>Constraints Mapping I had a project where I needed to look at constraints mapping for a series of project areas. Essentially I needed to look at a project and see what parts and how many layers it intersected with. The first thing I wanted to look at was how to go about automating as much as I could and since my python skills are still very green I looked into using the new to me QGIS process modeler.</description>
