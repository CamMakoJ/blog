      <description>I got this big idea in my head that I wanted to make it easier for co-workers to access the treasure trove of GIS data I have been collecting. Mostly just standard public datasets, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to pull them into your GIS Environment and view them along with the other layers your looking at. Originally I had setup a bunch of geopackages on dropbox to organize and share the datasets, however this required each user to download a local copy of the data and wasn&amp;rsquo;t terribly efficient.</description>
