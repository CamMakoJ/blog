      <description>I am headed up North to fish near Jasper this weekend. I am pretty excited I&amp;rsquo;ve never been up that way before and its with some good buddies. I have been prepping so far this week by tying up some flies, which I am still learning but there are some simpler streamer patterns that I&amp;rsquo;m not too bad at.
This is just a little taste of what I was working on&amp;hellip; hopefully I will be able to post that some of these flies were super effective.</description>
