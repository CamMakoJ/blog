      <description>I have tried using Avenza PDF in the past on my phone but was never able to get an easily exportable map to work with it from QGIS. That was until I actually tried to google around a bit and figure out how to make it work. I am using QGIS 3.2 so was unable to use some of the plugins that I had found as they were for earlier versions of QGIS and haven&amp;rsquo;t been updated at this time.</description>
