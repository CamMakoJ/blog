      <description>I fell in love with gochujang when I went for Korean BBQ the first time with a friend. It&amp;rsquo;s subtle and sweet spice is delicious in so many unique ways. I found a recipe for my Anova sous-vide on their site and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to try it.
Overall it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much work and it definitely was good practice with frying in the pan. That same friend who introduced me to gochujang also showed me some better frying technique when he made me some mad good spring rolls.</description>
