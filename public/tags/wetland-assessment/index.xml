      <description>To properly assess wetlands it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand what is happening to surface water at and near the wetland itself. If you have a digital elevation model from LIDAR or something similar then you can look at visually to determine the catchment areas and slope direction, however in some cases I find the overall surface to be too flat to effectively do this visually. I also find that using software to do the math is a lot easier&amp;hellip; and more reproducible.</description>
