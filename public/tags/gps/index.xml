      <description>Quite often for environmental field work I need to convert shapefiles or other GIS formats into GPX files. Now this would seem like it should be a simple task for the mighty QGIS. However in many cases its not as simple as hitting export and choosing the gpx file type. What I have found is super helpful is considering what I typically see in GPX files. Routes, Tracks, and Waypoints. This is a little different then the points, lines, and polygons of the shapefile world.</description>
