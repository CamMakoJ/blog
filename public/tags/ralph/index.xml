      <description>Our little dude Ralph is pretty awesome. We have been working pretty hard to get him trained up&amp;hellip; so hopefully one day he can come fishing with me. So far he has been with me for some short fishing sessions of an hour or so, but never longer&amp;hellip; he starts to get bored, and he isn&amp;rsquo;t at the place I can totally trust him off leash just yet. He also hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a huge fan of the water.</description>
