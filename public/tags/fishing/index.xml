      <description>I love getting out of town and camping. It&amp;rsquo;s just so nice to spend all day outside and finish the night around a campfire and fall asleep in a tent to the quiet sounds of a stream. It was super nice to get out and fish with my dad as well. We were lucky enough to get into a few brown trout, which are my favourite. I was hoping with the warm weather we would be able to have some success on the dry, but they were only sub-surface feeding while we were there.</description>

      <description>I am headed up North to fish near Jasper this weekend. I am pretty excited I&amp;rsquo;ve never been up that way before and its with some good buddies. I have been prepping so far this week by tying up some flies, which I am still learning but there are some simpler streamer patterns that I&amp;rsquo;m not too bad at.
This is just a little taste of what I was working on&amp;hellip; hopefully I will be able to post that some of these flies were super effective.</description>
