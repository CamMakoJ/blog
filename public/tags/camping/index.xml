      <description>I love getting out of town and camping. It&amp;rsquo;s just so nice to spend all day outside and finish the night around a campfire and fall asleep in a tent to the quiet sounds of a stream. It was super nice to get out and fish with my dad as well. We were lucky enough to get into a few brown trout, which are my favourite. I was hoping with the warm weather we would be able to have some success on the dry, but they were only sub-surface feeding while we were there.</description>
