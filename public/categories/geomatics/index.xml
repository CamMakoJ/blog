      <description>LeafletJS Leaflet JS is a javascript library for the creation of web maps. I wanted to use it to create a simple web-map for viewing the Alberta Merged Wetland Inventory (AMWI) streamed via a web map service (WMS). Eventually I would like to be able to upload a shapefile to zoom to an area and determine if an area does intersect any mapped wetlands. To access the WMS for the AMWI I used the links available in Alberta&amp;rsquo;s open data portal.</description>

      <description>I have long wanted to blog more consistently but always got bogged down in what service to use, and how to use it&amp;hellip; or whether I should wait until I could build one myself. Fortunately I came to my senses and no longer think building it from scratch myself makes sense, so I went with a happy medium and am using Hugo and firebase for my needs. Hopefully this helps me learn a bit of website management as well as some more &amp;lsquo;coding&amp;rsquo; skills in my quest for a better understanding of the web.</description>
