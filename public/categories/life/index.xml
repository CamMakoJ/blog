      <description>I love getting out of town and camping. It&amp;rsquo;s just so nice to spend all day outside and finish the night around a campfire and fall asleep in a tent to the quiet sounds of a stream. It was super nice to get out and fish with my dad as well. We were lucky enough to get into a few brown trout, which are my favourite. I was hoping with the warm weather we would be able to have some success on the dry, but they were only sub-surface feeding while we were there.</description>

      <description>I fell in love with gochujang when I went for Korean BBQ the first time with a friend. It&amp;rsquo;s subtle and sweet spice is delicious in so many unique ways. I found a recipe for my Anova sous-vide on their site and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to try it.
Overall it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much work and it definitely was good practice with frying in the pan. That same friend who introduced me to gochujang also showed me some better frying technique when he made me some mad good spring rolls.</description>

      <description>I am headed up North to fish near Jasper this weekend. I am pretty excited I&amp;rsquo;ve never been up that way before and its with some good buddies. I have been prepping so far this week by tying up some flies, which I am still learning but there are some simpler streamer patterns that I&amp;rsquo;m not too bad at.
This is just a little taste of what I was working on&amp;hellip; hopefully I will be able to post that some of these flies were super effective.</description>

      <description>I have been trying to read more lately, and by read its been mostly audiobooks. I recently discovered that I can use my local libraries online system to get both e-books and audiobooks on my phone for free which is awesome!
Check out Libby it is an awesome front end for using your local library resources, and at least where I live its totally free. Definitely worth checking out if you like reading or listening to books.</description>

      <description>I have long wanted to blog more consistently but always got bogged down in what service to use, and how to use it&amp;hellip; or whether I should wait until I could build one myself. Fortunately I came to my senses and no longer think building it from scratch myself makes sense, so I went with a happy medium and am using Hugo and firebase for my needs. Hopefully this helps me learn a bit of website management as well as some more &amp;lsquo;coding&amp;rsquo; skills in my quest for a better understanding of the web.</description>
