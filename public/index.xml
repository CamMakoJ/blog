      <description>I am headed up North to fish near Jasper this weekend. I am pretty excited I&amp;rsquo;ve never been up that way before and its with some good buddies. I have been prepping so far this week by tying up some flies, which I am still learning but there are some simpler streamer patterns that I&amp;rsquo;m not too bad at.
This is just a little taste of what I was working on&amp;hellip; hopefully I will be able to post that some of these flies were super effective.</description>

      <title>Creating a DEM from Contours</title>

      <description>Contours Contours are a great way to visualize topography on a flat map without covering background imagery. It is often great for figures where you want a visible basemap.
Digital Elevation Model That being said it is nice to have a digital elevation model (DEM) for easier interpretation of what the ground is looking like. I find this easier to see where there are steep slopes and depressions that may be wetlands.</description>

      <description>Constraints Mapping I had a project where I needed to look at constraints mapping for a series of project areas. Essentially I needed to look at a project and see what parts and how many layers it intersected with. The first thing I wanted to look at was how to go about automating as much as I could and since my python skills are still very green I looked into using the new to me QGIS process modeler.</description>

      <description>I have been trying to read more lately, and by read its been mostly audiobooks. I recently discovered that I can use my local libraries online system to get both e-books and audiobooks on my phone for free which is awesome!
Check out Libby it is an awesome front end for using your local library resources, and at least where I live its totally free. Definitely worth checking out if you like reading or listening to books.</description>

      <title>LeafletJS Maps</title>

      <description>LeafletJS Leaflet JS is a javascript library for the creation of web maps. I wanted to use it to create a simple web-map for viewing the Alberta Merged Wetland Inventory (AMWI) streamed via a web map service (WMS). Eventually I would like to be able to upload a shapefile to zoom to an area and determine if an area does intersect any mapped wetlands. To access the WMS for the AMWI I used the links available in Alberta&amp;rsquo;s open data portal.</description>

      <title>ACIMS App</title>

      <description>About the app The ACIMS app was developed after experiencing the frustration of forgetting the ACIMS list at home and trying to download the spreadsheet onto my phone. Spreadsheets in general aren&amp;rsquo;t awesome experiences on mobile and can be quite cumbersome. This was definitely the case with the massive ACIMS list and so I wanted to make it better. I also have always been interested in learning to code for a long time but hadn&amp;rsquo;t had the motivation to seriously learn.</description>

      <description>I started working on a write up of the ACIMS app that I made as a project. The intent of the writeup is both so that I can document what I did properly, but also so that I can hopefully share with others the process I went through. Though this is mostly to help me improve my understanding of what I have worked on, as having not re-visited it in awhile its very easy to forget.</description>

      <description>I have long wanted to blog more consistently but always got bogged down in what service to use, and how to use it&amp;hellip; or whether I should wait until I could build one myself. Fortunately I came to my senses and no longer think building it from scratch myself makes sense, so I went with a happy medium and am using Hugo and firebase for my needs. Hopefully this helps me learn a bit of website management as well as some more &amp;lsquo;coding&amp;rsquo; skills in my quest for a better understanding of the web.</description>
